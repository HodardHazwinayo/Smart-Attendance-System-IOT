# Smart-Attendance-System-IOT

This is a finger print based attendance system. The features of this system include:-
• Attendance marking using finger print scanning
• Attendance will be marked course wise wherein before the attendance is taken the course id is entered using the keypad
• Storage of student details on cloud using wifi module
• SMS or email notification when the student takes a leave
• The student report will be available to the student as well as the faculty in the
form of an android application

# Advantages:
• It's a much convenient way to track the attendance of student
• Students cannot cheat the system and give proxies
• It is even better than the systems which are RFID based since students tend to
forget the cards or misplace them
• It also helps the student as well as the faculty to have the log of attendance
using an android application.
• It alerts the student if the student takes more than a certain amount of leaves so
that the student can now be careful about that in future.
